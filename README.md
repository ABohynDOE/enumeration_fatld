# Enumeration of regular fractional factorial designs with four-level and two-level factors

This repository holds the code to reproduce the results from our paper "Enumeration of regular fractional factorial designs with four-level and two-level factors".
It contains the program to run the enumeration using:

- ST-NAUTY procedure
- DOP-NAUTY procedure
